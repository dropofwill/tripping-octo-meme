**Intended Message (need to synthesize with current creative):**

1. Children are being sold for sex.

2. Buyers, not just traffickers

3. Buyers are people who give something of value to have sex with a minor.

4. Buyers hide in plain site among us

5. Trafficking only stops when the demand for it does

6. Quotes from victims:
		Super Bowl, child porn, strip club, and demand insight.

7. Buyers turn our children into commodities, which causes their victimization.

8. Historically this crime has been hidden. This site tracks and brings it to light.

9. Is your state #DemandingJustice? Are you? (footage? twitter?)

10. Legal Disclaimer -> Enter report/home page


**Creative Message:**

1. There is no easy way to spot a buyer. (4)

2. Trafficker gets rich. Victim gets arrested. Buyer goes home. (1-3)

3. It is elementary. The more buyers demand, the more victims are supplied. (5)

4. There is only one way to close the store. Stop the buyers from shopping there. (7)

### Resources

[List of Resources](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5r0jz326jestk27/AAC-zi17VmP7F_QSD4vjwTJaa/Resource%20Page)

Basically each resource is probably going to need a thumbnail and a little explanation blurb. Legal briefs might need to each be their own item?
